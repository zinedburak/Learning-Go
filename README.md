# Learning-Go
This is a prjoct that is based on the teachings of the learning go class from e-learning

# Essential Syntax Rules
- Go is case sensitive
- Variable and package  names are lowercase and mixed case
- Names of public fields have initial upperCase characters (Meaning that if a field starts with upper case it is equivelant of public variable_name in java )
- Initial uppercase character means the symbol is exported
- Line feed ends a statement; no semicolon required
- Semicolons are part of the formal language spec
- The lexer (Software component that parses your code and analyzes your code ) adds the semicolons as needed
- If a statement determind to be complete and the lexer incounters a line feed that means that it is end of the statement.
